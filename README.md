### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Are Presidents What They Say?
+ This project is conducted by Ziwei Meng

+ Project summary: In this project, we basically asked 3 questions, *How does Republican focus differently from Democratic*, *How does words-choosing reflect national economic environment*, and *How does presidents’ moods change at farewell compared to inauguration*. Crude answers are, Republicans call for jobs while Democrats call for money, a nominee’s speech is more practical then a president, while a newly-elected president is happier than a nominee. 

+ To go through the analysis, open <a href="https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spr2017-Proj1-ZiweiMeng/blob/master/doc/Are%20Presidents%20What%20They%20Say.html">doc/Are Presidents What They Say.html</a> in your browser.
